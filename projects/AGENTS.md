# Projects AGENTS

Specs for initiatives — plan, repos, research/results pointers — not chronicles.

Ingest simply; do not duplicate skills or paste root Critical — link [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md). Flat taxonomy: each initiative lives in `projects/<slug>/README.md` with YAML frontmatter `status: proposed | active | ongoing | completed`. Human-requested non-spec notes: [`notes/`](./notes/) (see nested [`notes/AGENTS.md`](./notes/AGENTS.md)).

## Status values (YAML frontmatter)

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `proposed` | Evaluation / pitch |
| `active` | In flight |
| `ongoing` | Long-lived maintenance |
| `completed` | Done; freeze history elsewhere |

## Rules

- Flat slug folder: `projects/<slug>/README.md`.
- Required YAML frontmatter:

  ```yaml
  ---
  status: active # proposed | active | ongoing | completed
  owner: router
  repos: [ai-router]
  ---
  ```

- Required sections in `README.md`:
  - `## Intent`: Goal and core problem statement.
  - `## Current state`: Active progress and baseline facts.
  - `## Completed work`: Milestones delivered.
  - `## Plan / next actions`: Concrete remaining tasks and execution steps.
  - `## Exit criteria`: Definitive completion conditions.
  - `## Risks & mitigations`: Key failure modes and mitigations.
  - `## Related repos & paths`: Links to touched workspaces and trees.
  - `## Research & results pointers`: Links to deep research dossiers and results deliverables.
  - `## Decisions (links to docs/)`: Pointers to normative standards.
  - `## Open questions`: Unresolved architecture questions or trade-offs.
- Do not store ongoing history here — point at `research/`, `results/`; provenance via change-history scripts.
- Update `status:` field in YAML frontmatter on status change (do not move directories; eliminates dead relative link churn).
- Nested `AGENTS.md` only if a subfolder's process truly diverges (`notes/` does).
- **`notes/`:** human drop for informal thoughts, memos, or things to follow up on that have not yet been established as a formal project or had any real planning done beyond a vague note. Created only by human request; one kebab-case Markdown file per concern (dated prefix OK). Not a chronicle, not `research/`, not `docs/` standards, not `actionable/` intake. Promote to `projects/<slug>/` when a note receives concrete scoping or becomes a real initiative.
- **`project-prompts/`:** lean follow-up prompts for human-initiated agent runs on incomplete proposals, live OAuth tests, or untested generic skills. Non-authoritative, non-normative, and never used autonomously by agents.
- If a catalogued skill owns material remaining work, spawn that `owner_agent`. Parent runs isolate CLI; session-end gates stay with the parent. Nested files MUST NOT undo root spawn-if-material.
