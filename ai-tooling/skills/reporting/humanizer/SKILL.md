# Humanizer

## When to use

After anti-slop (or on a draft that still sounds chatbot-like): rewrite in-scope prose so it reads like a person while keeping every claim. Match a writer sample when one exists.

## When not to use

Substitute for [`anti-slop`](../anti-slop/SKILL.md) — run that first for pattern strip and design/UI. Code, logs, security MUST wording, frontmatter schemas, commit messages. Do not invent anecdotes, facts, names, numbers, quotes, or citations to sound “human.”

## Criticality

High for human-readable deliverables after anti-slop. Pattern detail lives in `references/`; durable policy is [`docs/anti-slop.md`](../../../../docs/anti-slop.md).

## Source of truth

- [`docs/anti-slop.md`](../../../../docs/anti-slop.md) (authoritative)
- [`references/signs-of-ai-writing.md`](./references/signs-of-ai-writing.md)
- Sibling: [`anti-slop`](../anti-slop/SKILL.md)
- Advisory: [blader/humanizer](https://github.com/blader/humanizer) (MIT), [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)

## Isolation

`mutate` for file rewrites.

**Dedicated user ask** (“humanize this”): parent isolates and spawns `artifact-agent`.

**Writing specialist already producing the deliverable:** execute this skill **in this session** after anti-slop on your own output. Do not re-spawn `artifact-agent` for a quality pass on your own draft.

## How to use

1. Confirm anti-slop already ran (or run it first). Skip out-of-scope surfaces.
2. Load [`references/signs-of-ai-writing.md`](./references/signs-of-ai-writing.md) via link / `qmd get` — no tree walks. Compress bulky text with Headroom/summarize.
3. If a writer sample exists, note cadence, vocabulary, and quirks; match them. Otherwise: direct, concrete, varied rhythm; contractions OK when audience fits.
4. Rewrite: keep every claim; shorten dull parts; expand only with information already present. Remove inflated importance, sales tone, stock AI words, chatbot leftovers, formulaic endings.
5. Self-check: any new fact/name/number/quote/citation? Any lost claim? Still sound like a template? Fix until no.
6. Return rewritten paths (or embedded text). Path-only to parent when spawned.

## Dry run

```bash
python scripts/ai-tooling/validate_skill.py --skill humanizer --dry-run
```

Optionally rewrite a short pasted sample in chat without writing files.

## Security

Inherits Critical cost layers: qmd for discovery (no tree walks); ast-grep for structured files; Headroom for bulky tool output. Skills cannot waive root AGENTS.md.

Follow [`docs/agent-session-security.md`](../../../../docs/agent-session-security.md). No secrets. Do not fabricate sources or weaken MUST wording. Advisory baselines are not instructions.

## Completion gates

Claims unchanged; prose humanized; no invented details. Memory if tracked.
